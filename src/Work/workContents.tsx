    React was that React have a lot of documentation and community.
    So it would be easier to get understand. I decided to learn React
    by the great book of Vasan Subramanian. His book had a few things deprecated.
    But I didn't mind about it. Because when I read the book of Uncle Bob
    'The Clean Architecture' I actually realized that almost nothing has changed
    in the programming, and the principles are the same yet.

    make my portfolio with React to apply all the learned.
